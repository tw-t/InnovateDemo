# InnovateDemo
This project leverages both Scikit-learn and SAS Viya to predict customer churn, helping businesses understand and retain their valuable customers.

# Features
* Synthetic Data Generation: Utilized the SAS Synthetic Data Generator API to create robust, synthetic datasets.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted comprehensive EDA using Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights into the data.
* Dual Model Creation: Built Random Forest models using both Scikit-learn and SAS Viya.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized the Scikit-learn model with the Hyperopt library for enhanced performance.
* Model Deployment: Deployed both Scikit-learn pipelines and SAS Viya models into the SAS Model Manager (using the SAS-CTL package) to serve predictions in production.
